Yet Another IRC Bot

It's the way all cool kids name their project currently so i went with it. This is my attempt at some kind of IRC Bot with a few commands and some random messing about.

It's using paralins IrcDotNet Framework to do the IRC part (https://github.com/IrcDotNet/IrcDotNet)

By no means at all is this meant to be fully functional at all times. Also Updates will be random and seldom as this is more for personal interest than actual need. If you have ideas or features feel free to post them - don't expect them to be implemented though. Thanks in advance for any constructive advice given.
